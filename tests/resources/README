In the event the testing environment moves, the database is corrupted 
or any scripts are lost or damaged, the database can be completely
rebuilt (or established) using the scripts contained in the 
mysqlsetup_*.tar.gz or the sqlitesetup_*.tar.gz archive files.

Each *.tar.gz file is created in their respective database directory in
/var/admin/database/dblib_test, on the 73DEVLTP02 development PC. The 
archive file is stored to the 'archive' directory at the path above, 
and into this directory.

The *.sh shell scripts are wrappers around the .sql scripts and can be 
used for deployment or database teardown. These shell scripts are executed
by the testing modules via a subprocess call.
